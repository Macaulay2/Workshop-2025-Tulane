# Mini school

**Leaders: Anton Leykin (Georgia Tech) and Mike Stillman (Cornell)**

This mini school will take 1.5 days (Monday afternoon and Tuesday) and will cover some basic topics for Macaulay2 beginners.
Please follow announcements on zulip. 

The topics will include 
* Basic data types (lists, hash tables, ...)
* Functions and methods
* Basic package development

Our current plan is to have hands-on tutorials with some demonstrations followed by 
small (randomly generated) groups working on coding exercises. 

This file resides in the git repo branch `MiniSchool` which we will use for sharing files and as a git "playground".
